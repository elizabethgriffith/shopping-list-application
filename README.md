# shopping-list-application
An application to input groceries and sort them into categories for easy visualization.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This app was made using vanilla JavaScript to take in the inputs from a form, store them in local storage, and sort them into different categories. This was accomplished using event listeners, parent and child relationships, and DOM manipulation. Functionality added that helped catch potential errors are warnings when deleting elements, and alerts when a form submission is attempted with empty fields.

## Lessons Learned:

Being my first application using only vanilla JavaScript, this app expanded my knowledge immensely. Building this app solidified my understanding of parent/child relationships and the possibilites available by utilizing them. Specifically, this build taught me how to target specific elements and to add elements into the DOM using their parent relationships.

Another big takeaway from this application was the use of local storage. This app allowed me to store user input data and retrieve it on the page reload, as well as remove data from local storage. I learned how to turn user inputs into objects that I could then store in local storage using JSON stringify and JSON parse. This skill is something I will likely use in all further projects and is the foundation of this applications usability.
